    <h1>It is not a good practice to put any HTML tags other than the TITLE in the HEAD section </h1>
    <h2>We can also use heading tags in the body of the document.</h2>
    <h4>This text is in fourth level heading</h4>
    <h6>This text is in sixth level heading</h6>
    <br />
    <i>This is plain italicized text </i>
    <h3><b><i> This text is third level, bold and italicized </i></b></h3>
</body>
</html>

NOTE: Comments can be embedded anywhere in an HTML document except preformatted text.
	<P>
    organizes multiple lines of text into a paragraph
    	A blank line is placed after the paragraph
    	HTML is self formatting. We need a <BR> to force the display to another line (or we can use the <PRE> to ask the browser not to format the text).

Example: Try removing the <PRE> and </PRE> tags and viewing the following file again. Experiment by changing the browser window size.

<P>
    I enjoy developing Web Applications Using ASP.
    ASP has several COM based prebuilt objects that
    can be used in a scripting language such as VBscript,
    or Javascript, or Perlscript etc..
</P>
<P>
    ASP is easy to learn and you can create very useful Web
    applications relatively quickly, with it
</P>
      	To learn more about ASP, I will recommend taking a course on it
